This simple project stands as an exploration into the practical implementation of AI within real-world problem-solving scenarios. By harnessing neural network methodologies, we developed a solution that presents users with the most probable disease predictions when given one or multiple symptoms.

Notably, the backbone of our AI model was trained using authentic datasets sourced from real-world health data. Our initiative not only showcases the potential of AI in healthcare but also highlights its capability to assist users in early disease identification and understanding.
